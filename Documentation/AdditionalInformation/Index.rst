Sponsoring & Bugfixing

Nobody is perfect and nothing is complete. Out of those 2 simple
reason there is still a chance that some bugs made it into your
version of addresslist4cal. If you found a bug, please check the `issues page`_
if the bug has already been reported (and maybe even already been fixed) and if
this is not the case please report it there!

Everyone of the team got already a regular job, wife and plenty of
hobbies. Please understand that there are weeks and months with not
that much free time for TYPO3 and this extension. Chances of bugfixes
and implementation of features rises with sponsoring!

Help, especially including patches, is of course always welcome!

could have been spent in so many other ways too. If you like this
extension, it would be awesome if you could do one (or all) of the
following proposals:

  the general TYPO3 mailing lists. Mostly you can meet the developer in person

  user group RheinRuhr in the *Ruhrgebiet* (Germany).
- **Spread the word!** If you like this extension, tell your friends,
  colleagues,... about it.

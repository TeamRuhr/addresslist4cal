Users manual
============

In the BE you only have to select the tt_address records which should
be displayed within the cal event display.

The needed changes for the cal event template are described in the
:ref:`my-templating-label` section.

If you want to add a link to a detail page, using wt_directory for example, you can add TypoScript configuration
to add creation of the target url of the detail page.
